# To Submit this Assignment
  * fork this repository
  * write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-duncan`
  * push to your repository
  * submit a pull request to this repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas
  * write a question and observation on canvas

# Build Tool Instructions
* create a package.json that lists all dependencies and developer dependencies
* include an .eslintrc
* include a .gitignore
* include a readme with project description
* create a gulpfile

# Directions
* Create these directories to organize your code:
 * lib
 * model
 * test
* Create a HTTP Server using the http module
* Create a Object Constructor that creates a _simple resource_ with at least 3 properties
 * An `id` property that is set to a unique **node-uuid** id is required
 * Also include two other properties of your choice (like name, creationDate, etc.)
* Create a body parser to parse the json in the body of `POST` and `PUT` requests
* Create a url parser that uses nodes `url` and `querystring` modules parse the request url
* Create a Router Constructor that manages requests to `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests
* Create a route for doing `CREATE`, `READ`, and `DELETE` operations on your _simple resource_
* Create a storage module that will store resources by their type and id

## Server Endpoints
### `/api/simple-resource-name`
* `POST` request
 * pass data as stringifed json in the body of a post request to create a resource
* `GET` request
 * pass an `?id=<uuid>` in the query string to retrieve a specific resource as json
* `DELETE` request
 * pass an `?id=<uuid>` in the query string to delete a specific resource
 * should return 204 status with no content in the body

## Tests
* your tests should start your server when they begin and stop your server when they finish
* write a test to ensure that your api returns a status code of 404 for routes that have not been registered
* write tests to ensure your `/api/simple-resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
 * `GET` - test 404, responds with 'not found' for valid request made with an id that was not found
 * `GET` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' if no id was provided in the request
 * `GET` - test 200, response body like `{<data>}` for a request made with a valid id
 * `POST` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' for if no `body provided` or `invalid body`
 * `POST` - test 200, response body like  `{<data>}` for a post request with a valid body

## Bonus
* **2pts** a `GET` request to `/api/simple-resource-name` with no **?id=** should return an array of all of the ids for that resource

### Alternatives for implementing promises
* Create a body parser that uses Promises to parse the json in the body of `POST` and `PUT` requests
* Create a url parser that returns a promise and uses nodes `url` and `querystring` modules parse the request url
